# LogWrapper
Application for WSCC CommTrace and TraceLog analysis plus export to SOAP UI and image extract.
WSCC V02 partial support, see how to document.


#WARNING
Because some of the files may be restricted by Diebold Nixdorf, this is for internal use only, please ask me for additional 
files that are needed in order to use this tool on matej.bludsky@gmail.com or matej.bludsky@dieboldnixdorf.com

See documentation on how to import missing content
##UPDATE
Looks like SOAP UI doesnt require the WSDL files at all so this tool should work just fine without the WSDL folder mentioned above.
